'cause every time you hurt me the less that I cry
and every time you leave me the quicker these tears dry
and every time you walk out the less I love you
baby we don't have a chance, it's sad but is true
I'm way too good at goodbyes.

I'm never gonna let you get close to me
even if you mean the most to me
'cause every time I open up it hurts.

i'm never gonna get too close to you
even if when i mean the most for you
in case you go and leave me in the dirt...
